					It was incredibly fun to get to know you through the messages I sent to you anonymously. As a person who in love with the Russian language and culture, I created this simple webpage filled with Russian classical and contemporary love poems.
					С Днем святого Валентина and good luck in your studies in Russian and in school.

						<blockquote>
							Я вас любил: любовь ещё, быть может,<br />В душе моей угасла не совсем;<br />
							Но пусть она вас больше не тревожит;<br />
							Я не хочу печалить вас ничем.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote class="poem-eng">I loved you once: perhaps that love has yet<br />To die down thoroughly within my heart;<br />But let it not dismay you any longer;<br />I have no wish to cause you any sorrow.</blockquote>
						<blockquote class="poet">- "I Loved You" by Alexander Pushkin</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p class="description">
						A poem about lost love and the speaker's attempts to move on from that love. The speaker acknowledges that his love for the addressee has not entirely died within his heart, but he no longer wishes to cause them any sorrow. The poem is
						bittersweet, with a sense of resignation and acceptance that the relationship has ended, but with a lingering sadness and longing. The poem is considered one of Pushkin's most famous and poignant works.

					<div class="poem">
						<blockquote>Любовь! как мучительно мне с тобой!<br />Я не могу и жить и умереть.<br />Мой бедный дух обречен на терпенье,<br />А сердце молчит и не хочет верить.</blockquote>
						<blockquote>Love! How painful it is to be with you!<br />I cannot live and I cannot die.<br />My poor spirit is doomed to suffer,<br />While my heart remains silent and refuses to believe.</blockquote>
						<blockquote class="poet">- "Love" by Marina Tsvetaeva</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p class="description">
						A poem that explores the speaker's conflicted emotions towards love. The speaker describes love as a painful experience that makes it difficult for her to live or die. Her spirit is resigned to suffering, while her heart remains silent
						and refuses to believe in the possibility of love. The poem reflects the complex and sometimes torturous nature of love, and the idea that it can bring both joy and pain. Tsvetaeva is known for her emotionally intense and lyrical poetry,
						and "Love" is a prime example of her style.
