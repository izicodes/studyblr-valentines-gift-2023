					It was incredibly fun to get to know you through the messages I sent to you anonymously. As a person who in love with the Russian language and culture, I created this simple webpage filled with Russian classical and contemporary love poems.
					С Днем святого Валентина and good luck in your studies in Russian and in school.

							Я вас любил: любовь ещё, быть может,<br />В душе моей угасла не совсем;<br />
							Но пусть она вас больше не тревожит;<br />
							Я не хочу печалить вас ничем.

						<h3 class="poet">"Love" by Marina Tsvetaeva</h3>
